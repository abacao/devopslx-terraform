# **Terraform Presentation**
## *"Terraform your Cloud" - by André Bação*

<br><br>

This repo has the code and presentation that I made for the  [Lisbon DevOps meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Lisbon/events/238537338/) on the 10th of April 2017.

The presentation's goal to show how to start using Terraform for provisioning with the Infrastructure-as-Code way.

The presentation has some example files for resources as well as variables and outputs.

There is also a video that shows a terraform run with a ansible provisioning and the display of that provisioning.

All the code for the demo is in this repo.

The only thing needed to replicate this is a DigitalOcean API key.
